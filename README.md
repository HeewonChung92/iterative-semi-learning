For the classification problem in practice, one of the challenging issues is to obtain labeled data. Moreover, even if such labeled data has been sufficiently accumulated, most datasets often exhibit long-tailed distribution with heavy class imbalance. In order to minimize the difficulty of data labeling and the imbalanced dataset problem, semi-supervised learning using additional unlabeled data has been considered. However, as a matter of course, the accuracy is much lower than that of supervised learning under the condition that accurately label the additional unlabeled data. In this study, we propose a methodology of the semi-supervised learning, which iteratively corrects the labeling of the extra unlabeled data based on softmax probabilities. The results show that the proposed algorithms provide the accuracy as high as that of the supervised learning. To validate the proposed algorithms, we tested on the two scenarios: balanced dataset and imbalanced datasets. With both scenarios, our proposed semi-supervised learning method provided the classification accuracy very close to the supervised learning.
